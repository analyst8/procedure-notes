    "- winner: the signal had a certain time-trend that caused some issues specifically on mean and quantile based features. To partly overcome this, we added a constant noise to each 150k segment (both in train and test) by calculating np.random.normal(0, 0.5, 150_000). Additionally, after noise addition, we subtracted the median of the segment.\n",
    "- i did a bar chart of the most common values. The values were all very small. So i subtracted out a range of the small values.\n",
    "- One of our best final LGB model only used four features: (i) number of peaks of at least support 2 on the denoised signal, (ii) 20% percentile on std of rolling window of size 50, (iii) 4th and (iv) 18th Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients mean. We sometimes used a few more features (like for the NN, see below) but they are usually very similar. Those 4 are decently uncorrelated between themselves, and add good diversity. For each feature we always only considered it if it has a p-value >0.05 on a KS statistic of train vs test."
